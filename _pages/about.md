My name is Xingyu Chen. I'm currently pursuing an MPhil in the Audio & Acoustic Signal Processing Group at The Australian National University, supervised by [Prasanga Samarasinghe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C6sG-4QAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Fei Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dBB_bqEAAAAJ&hl=en). My passion lies in integrating machine learning methods with acoustic domain knowledge to push the boundaries of acoustic and audio signal processing. I aim to make contributions that enhance both the theoretical foundations and practical applications within this field.
