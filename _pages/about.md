I'm Xingyu Chen, and I'm currently pursuing an MPhil in the Audio & Acoustic Signal Processing Group at The Australian National University. My passion lies in integrating machine learning methods with acoustic domain knowledge to push the boundaries of acoustic and audio signal processing. I aim to make contributions that enhance both the theoretical foundations and practical applications within this field.
